# set a var false
# while var = false, check if outside temp is lower than inside temp. 
# if outside temp is lower than inside temp, notify user
# set var to true
# while var = true, check if outside temp = inside temp. notify user
# set var to false
# repeat 

# how long do we need to wait before checking the temp so as not to notify user prematurely
# the idea is to tell the user in the evening or morning whether it's time to open/close the windows
